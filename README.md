# Project-Procrastinator
A simple calendar application that lets users add, delete, and view events. My goal is to eventually turn it into a personal ‘Procrastination Tool’ that helps me track deadlines and tasks in a way that matches my own habits. The project uses core CS210 data structures(SDSU) while keeping the design fun and beginner-friendly.
